Over the past 2 years, it has evolved into a personal art history companion, guiding my personal exploration of the vast collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n<br/><br/>\nEach day on metitate.art, a new gallery is unveiled, showcasing objects ranging from European masterpieces to ancient sarcophagi. An algorithm of my own design prioritizes the most intriguing objects based on factors like age, materials, and artist renown.\n\nUsers can curate their own digital museums by collecting objects and adding them to their personal collections. This feature fosters a sense of ownership and encourages a deeper connection with art, as each collected artifact becomes exclusive to the user.\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.metitate.art\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Metitate.art</a>",

    "summary": "What began as a personal solution to streamline creative feedback evolved into an effective AI-powered tool for Indeed's creative teams. I identified a critical pain point: creative professionals were spending excessive time processing and responding to feedback, leading to decreased productivity and creative burnout. Taking initiative, I developed a Chrome extension prototype that dramatically simplified feedback management.\n\nThe initial prototype showed clear impact, reducing feedback processing time and preserving creative energy. This success caught the attention of my colleagues, who saw its practical value in their daily work. Leveraging my technical expertise and understanding of creative workflows, I secured internal funding from Indeed to expand the project.\n\nThe result was Finn, an AI-driven product that not only accelerates feedback processing but also helps maintain creative momentum. By bridging my experience in creative direction with technical innovation, I transformed a personal productivity hack into a robust enterprise solution that makes creative teams' work more efficient and sustainable.",
