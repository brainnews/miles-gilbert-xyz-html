                <p>I'm a creative director with a proven track record of making complex tech concepts feel approachable and engaging. Throughout my career, I've worked with major technology companies like IBM, HP, and Indeed, crafting brand experiences that resonate across both physical and digital environments.</p>
                <p>Today, I help lead creative initiatives at Indeed, the world's #1 job site. Beyond directing video series and experiential campaigns, I drive innovation through technology—recently prototyping an AI-powered tool that streamlines our creative feedback process, and helping evaluate AI solutions that enhance our team's efficiency. My work focuses on modernizing both our creative output and our workflows to help people find and succeed in meaningful work.</p>
