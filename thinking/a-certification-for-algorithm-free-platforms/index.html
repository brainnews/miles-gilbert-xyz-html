                <figcaption>Proposed badge for a certification for algorithm-free platforms.</figcaption>
                <p>Why do we squint at organic certification labels in Whole Foods yet mindlessly swim through the algorithmic slurry of our social media feeds? The question nagged at me one afternoon as I stood in my kitchen, measuring cinnamon and agave nectar for a single serving of lemon-lime soda. This small act of resistance against Big Soda reminded me of a time on the internet before algorithms curated our digital lives, deciding what we see, read, and believe.</p>
                <p>The dominance of algorithmic content curation has fundamentally altered how we interact with information online. Social media feeds, news websites, and content platforms rely heavily on complex algorithms to dictate what users see and when they see it. Platforms characterize algorithmically-driven experiences as more "personalized" to the user. This may feel true, but algorithms also create filter bubbles, limit serendipitous discovery, and often prioritize engagement over quality and joy.</p>
                <p>Many people experience a loss of control over their digital experiences, feeling uncertain about why certain content appears in their feeds while the content they genuinely wish to see remains obscured. On TikTok, known for its eerily well-tuned algorithm, conspiracy theories about how it understands users and delivers content circulate widely as people attempt to untangle the complicated steps needed to reach their specific corner of the internet. Others abandon any effort to understand—embracing their algorithm like a hair shirt on the scarred back of a 14th-century ascetic, stating, “I built this FYP brick by brick.” They repent by liking and commenting, resigned to linger in their corner for as long as the algorithm allows. What can we do to avoid these unfortunate realities of life with computers?</p>
                <p>Consider the idea of Algorithm-Free Certification, a standardized label that websites and apps could earn by committing to transparent, non-algorithmic content delivery. Similar to how the Non-GMO Project verifies food products, this certification would require digital platforms to meet specific criteria and undergo regular audits. To qualify, platforms must demonstrate that their content delivery systems operate on clear, user-controlled principles instead of opaque recommendation algorithms.</p>
                <p>We’ve already seen evidence that users enjoy and are willing to pay for human-curated content. The Criterion Collection, known for its carefully curated film selections, offers playlists and collections handpicked by film experts and artists. Are.na, a platform for collecting and connecting ideas, deliberately avoids algorithmic recommendations in favor of genuine connections and discoveries. These platforms demonstrate that there's a growing market for thoughtfully curated content.</p>
                <img src="https://media.milesgilbert.xyz/thinking/a-certification-for-algorithm-free-platforms/non-algo-letterboxd.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 30px 0 8px;">
                <figcaption>Letterboxd, a platform for film recommendations and lists, is a prime example of a platform that could qualify for algorithm-free certification.</figcaption>
                <p>Other existing platforms that could potentially qualify for algorithm-free certification include Letterboxd, where film recommendations primarily stem from human reviews and lists, and RSS readers like Feedly, which present content in chronological order from sources you specifically choose to follow. Additionally, some newsletters and digital magazines, which depend on editorial judgment rather than algorithms to determine content placement, could also display this certification.</p>
                <p>The certification label would be a visible badge on qualifying websites and apps, instantly recognizable to users. Imagine browsing the App Store for a news app and spotting the Certified Non-Algorithmic label on the third most downloaded app. Would you choose that one over the top-downloaded app? Would it reassure you to know that the stories you're reading were selected by individual humans and arranged in a simple chronological order instead of being picked by an engagement-optimizing algorithm? Or envision a social media platform where your feed displays everything your friends post rather than just what an algorithm thinks you want to see.</p>
                <p>This certification offers users a new way to regain control over their digital diet. Just as some consumers select organic produce for health benefits, many would value the option to choose algorithm-free spaces for their mental health. Websites and apps implementing this certification could stand out in a saturated market, appealing to users who prioritize transparency and authenticity and potentially earning premium subscriptions for their human-curated experiences.</p>
                <p>Implementing a certification system like this would present significant challenges. Technical standards must be established to clearly define what constitutes "algorithm-free" in various contexts. A credible verification process is essential for maintaining the integrity of the certification. The biggest obstacle would be convincing major platforms, many of which have based their business models on algorithmic content curation, to provide algorithm-free alternatives. But maybe we don’t need Instagram, etc., to get on board. Maybe we just need new platforms.</p>
                <p>As users grow more aware of how algorithms influence their online experiences, the demand for transparent alternatives will likely grow. The Algorithm-Free Certification could help people take control of their feeds and advance the conversation about digital well-being and personal autonomy.</p>
                <p>So, are you ready to take back control? Start with a home made soda:</p>
