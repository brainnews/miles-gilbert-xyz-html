                <p>Early June, 2021. The Battery, a wedge of land splitting the city's hustle, the breath of summer already clinging thick. Not the finest stroll, not with the humidity painting the air sticky. A woman pushing a stroller, headphones in her ears, podcast drowning out my whispered "Excuse me". The path curved ahead, a mundane promise of mysteries as ordinary as a bent lamppost or a chipped brick, waiting to be stumbled upon around the next corner.</p>
                
                <p>Rounding the bend, a sight: a blue director's chair, afloat in the air like a mirage. Closer, the full picture emerged. A pyramid, skeletal and loose, built of director's chairs. All bone white, save for one defiant splash of blue at the peak, straining upwards. Like those bicycle sculptures of Ai Weiwei, but this, a rebellion of underrepresented voices. A lone chair, bright and poised, rising above the rest.</p>

                <p>Installation concept and creative direction for the premiere of Rising Voices Season 1, Tribeca Film Festival.</p>
