                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Rising Voices is Indeed's annual indie film incubator dedicated to amplifying underrepresented voices. As Creative Director, I led the development of year 5's identity system.</p>

                <p>The visual identity is a celebration of color and energy. It uses playful, trendy design language—bubbly typography, vibrant sunburst patterns, and a bold orange-and-cyan palette—to create an optimistic, youthful tone that deliberately centers the filmmakers, with Indeed stepping back to play a supporting role.</p>
