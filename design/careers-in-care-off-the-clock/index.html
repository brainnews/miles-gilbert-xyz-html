                <p>As creative director for Indeed's Careers in Care Off the Clock campaign, I led the development of a series of videos and visual assets that celebrated the lives of healthcare workers beyond their shifts. The project included creating a series of short films that highlighted the personal stories and passions of healthcare workers, as well as a series of images that captured their lives outside of work. Through compelling storytelling and innovative visual design, we made the case for why healthcare workers deserve recognition and support.</p>
