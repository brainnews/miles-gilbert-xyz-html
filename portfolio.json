      "short": "I'm a creative technologist who believes great work happens when human creativity and AI-enabled tools work in tandem.",
      "full": "I'm a creative technologist who believes great work happens when human creativity and AI-enabled tools work in tandem. With a background in web development, creative direction, design, and marketing, I help Indeed's in-house agency build smarter creative workflows—from growth marketing and video production to illustration and social media. I think about the creative process holistically: where do humans make the irreplaceable decisions? Where can technology amplify what we do best? That's the sweet spot I'm always looking for. And it's always shifting. As new technologies emerge, that balance evolves, and staying effective means adapting alongside it.",
      "professional": "Experienced creative director focusing on translating complex technical concepts into compelling and accessible experiences across physical and digital spaces for global technology companies such as IBM, HP, and Indeed. Proven track record of building and leading cross-functional teams within large organizations and bringing cohesiveness to technology brands."

As the lead art director, I spearheaded a team that developed a unique blend of design and code, resulting in a visually striking identity that continues to inspire interactive experiences. The project was the culmination of a year of embedded research with the IBM team and collaboration with renowned visual artist Joshua Davis. The final product was prominently featured on the game show Jeopardy, where Watson famously competed against human champions, as well as in television commercials, an extended documentary, and print ads around the world, captivating global audiences. Over a decade later, the Watson identity remains an integral part of IBM's brand, a testament to its lasting impact and enduring relevance.",
