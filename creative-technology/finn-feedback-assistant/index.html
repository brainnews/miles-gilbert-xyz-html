                <p>Creative review at Indeed was overwhelming. A typical project generated 42+ comments from six different stakeholder groups—brand, marketing, legal, product, creative leadership—scattered across Google Slides and Frame.io. Teams spent hours manually consolidating feedback, prioritizing contradictory requests, and guessing at vague comments.</p>

                <p>I built Finn, a Chrome extension that uses AI to organize feedback so creatives can focus on craft instead of administrative work.</p>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>

                <p>Indeed Creative supports hundreds of projects annually—from national TV campaigns to internal communications reaching 12,000+ employees. Four core problems emerged:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> Processing 42+ comments from six stakeholder groups while mentally exhausted</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of confidence to push back:</strong> Junior designers couldn't challenge senior stakeholders even when feedback would compromise brand guidelines</li>
                    <li><strong>Unclear feedback:</strong> Vague comments like "this feels off" caused multiple unnecessary revision cycles</li>
                    <li><strong>Contradicting feedback:</strong> Marketing wanted more copy, Brand wanted less, Legal needed compliance language, Creative wanted simplicity—no way to surface conflicts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Experiments with ChatGPT</h2>

                <p>I tested ChatGPT with real Indeed feedback from Frame.io, asking it to provide solutions, craft diplomatic pushback, judge sentiment, and assess clarity.</p>

                <p>ChatGPT showed promise but wasn't practical. Copy-pasting 42 comments was too much friction, it lacked Indeed brand context, and we couldn't ensure consistent responses across teams. We needed a purpose-built tool.</p>

                <h2>Why Build a Custom Tool?</h2>

                <p>Five reasons to build instead of using ChatGPT directly:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistent communication:</strong> Standardized responses to stakeholders across Healthcare, Tech & IT, and performance marketing campaigns</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower friction:</strong> Chrome extension works directly in Google Slides and Frame.io—no copy-pasting required</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape AI perception:</strong> Frame AI as assistant for tedious work, not replacement for creative judgment</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather insights:</strong> Analyze patterns across hundreds of campaigns to identify which stakeholder groups contradict most, which briefs confuse teams</li>
                    <li><strong>Build toward custom model:</strong> Foundation for training on Indeed's brand guidelines and compliance requirements</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Solution: Finn</h2>

                <p>Finn is a Chrome extension that works directly in Google Slides and Frame.io. It's trained on Indeed's brand guidelines and allows the user to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Upload project brief for context</li>
                    <li>Auto-extract and categorize all comments</li>
                    <li>Identify patterns and flag contradictions</li>
                    <li>Generate structured action items by priority</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Finn Organizes Feedback</h2>

                <p>Finn categorizes all comments into four sections:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What's Working:</strong> Positive feedback to preserve and build upon</li>
                    <li><strong>What's Not Working:</strong> Issues organized by theme, not individual comments</li>
                    <li><strong>Universal Feedback:</strong> Comments applying to overall project</li>
                    <li><strong>Contradicting Feedback:</strong> Explicit callout when reviewers disagree</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Interactive Features</h2>

                <p>Hover over any feedback for three options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> Unpack vague comments like "this feels off"</li>
                    <li><strong>Pushback:</strong> Generate diplomatic, evidence-based responses</li>
                    <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Move text to clipboard</li>
                </ul>

                <div style="width: 100%; height: 500px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; background-color: #f1f1f1; padding-bottom: 20px;">

                <h2>Quick Prompts and Custom Chat</h2>

                <p>Four quick reorganization options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slide-by-Slide Analysis:</strong> Comments per slide with clickable links</li>
                    <li><strong>Organize by Commenter:</strong> Group by stakeholder</li>
                    <li><strong>Organize by Resource:</strong> Sort by content type (copy, design, video)</li>
                    <li><strong>Magic Question:</strong> AI-generated contextual question for reflection</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Chat interface for custom queries: reorganize by complexity, priority, quick fixes vs. discussion items, etc.</p>

                <figcaption>The chat interface allows for custom queries to organize feedback any way you need</figcaption>

                <h2>AI That Augments, Not Replaces</h2>

                <p>Finn doesn't make creative decisions—it handles tedious organizational work so designers can focus on craft. When a designer receives 42 comments, Finn organizes them in 2 minutes, freeing mental energy for actual creative problem-solving.</p>

                <p>By building our own tool, we ensured it serves Indeed's needs: understands brand guidelines, works in existing tools (Google Slides/Frame.io), frames AI as assistant not replacement.</p>

                <p>The framework—reduce cognitive load, increase confidence, promote objectivity, gather insights—can guide AI adoption across Indeed Creative's entire production process.</p>
